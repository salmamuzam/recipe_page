    <h1 style="color: #5b3644">Chicken Lasagne</h1>
    <p>
      Chicken lasagne is a wonderful dish for all the family. The cook has
      cheated with the white sauce, making a quick creamy sauce instead. There
      are fewer layers than in a traditional lasagne, but it’s still creamy and
      delicious. Soaking the lasagne sheets in water first ensures they will
      cook quickly.

    <p>For this recipe a shallow 1.8 litre/3¼ pint ovenproof dish is needed.</p>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>

      <li>
        To make the chicken mixture, put the oil in frying pan over a high heat.
        Add the chicken pieces and fry quickly until golden but not cooked. Add
        the chilli, garlic and mushrooms and fry for a few moments. Add the
        spinach and stir until wilted.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Measure the cornflour into a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons of
        water until smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add the crème fraîche and parsley to the pan with the chicken and stir.
        Pour in the cornflour mixture and stir until thickened. Set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To make the sauce, combine the tomatoes, sun-dried tomato paste and
        thyme in a bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper and mix well.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Soak the lasagne sheets in a shallow dish filled with boiling water for
        a few minutes until soft.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Spoon a third of the chicken mixture into the oven dish. Spoon a third
        of the tomato sauce over the chicken. Arrange 3 lasagne sheets on top.
        Repeat the layers again. Finish with a final layer of chicken mixture
        and sauce (making three layers of chicken mixture and sauce, and two
        layers of lasagne sheets). Sprinkle the top with grated cheddar and bake
        for 35-40 minutes, until golden-brown and cooked through. Serve with
        salad or green vegetables.
