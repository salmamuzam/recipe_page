# Chicken Lasagne Recipe Page

A simple, elegant HTML recipe page showcasing a delicious Chicken Lasagne recipe built as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Description

This project is a static recipe page that presents a complete Chicken Lasagne recipe with ingredients and step-by-step instructions. 

**What the application does:**

This recipe page displays a well-structured cooking guide that includes an introduction to the dish, a beautiful image of the finished meal, organized ingredient lists separated by preparation stage (chicken mixture, sauce, and assembly), and detailed step-by-step cooking instructions with proper attribution to the original source.

**Why the project used the technologies:**

I used pure HTML5 to focus on mastering semantic structure and proper document markup. Inline CSS was chosen for quick styling implementation while keeping the project simple and centered on HTML fundamentals. No JavaScript was needed since a recipe page is static content that doesn't require interactivity, making it perfect for practicing HTML-only development.

**Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future:**

The main challenges I faced were organizing multiple ingredient sections in a logical, readable format while meeting all 21 freeCodeCamp test requirements and balancing visual appeal with semantic HTML structure.

Features I hope to implement in the future include adding an external CSS stylesheet for better style organization, creating a print-friendly layout for easy recipe printing, including recipe metadata like prep time and servings, adding a nutritional information calculator, implementing a user rating and comments section, and creating a recipe scaling calculator for different serving sizes.
