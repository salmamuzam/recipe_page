# Chicken Lasagne Recipe Page

A simple, elegant HTML recipe page showcasing a delicious Chicken Lasagne recipe that I built as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Description

This project is a static recipe page that presents a complete Chicken Lasagne recipe with ingredients and step-by-step instructions. 

**What my application does:**

My recipe page displays a well-structured cooking guide that includes an introduction to the dish, a beautiful image of the finished meal, organized ingredient lists separated by preparation stage (chicken mixture, sauce, and assembly), and detailed step-by-step cooking instructions with proper credit to the original source.

**Why I used these technologies:**

I used pure HTML5 to focus on learning semantic structure and proper document markup. I chose inline CSS for quick styling to keep the project simple and focused on HTML basics. I didn't need JavaScript since a recipe page is static content that doesn't require interactivity, making it perfect for practicing HTML-only development.

**Challenges I faced and features I hope to add in the future:**

The main challenges I faced were organizing multiple ingredient sections in a clear, easy-to-read format while meeting all 21 freeCodeCamp test requirements and balancing visual appeal with semantic HTML structure.

In the future, I hope to add an external CSS stylesheet for better style organization, create a print-friendly layout for easy recipe printing, include recipe details like prep time and servings, add a nutritional information calculator, add a user rating and comments section, and create a recipe scaling calculator for different serving sizes.
