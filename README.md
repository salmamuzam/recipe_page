# Simple Recipe Web Page

This is a small web project I made using only HTML. It shows a chicken lasagne recipe with ingredients, steps, and a picture of the dish.

I made this to learn how to use basic HTML tags the right way.

## About the Project

The page has:

- A title with the recipe name
- A short introduction
- An image of the food
- A list of ingredients
- A list of cooking steps

It also follows HTML rules like using `<!DOCTYPE html>` and setting the language to English.

## Why I Made It

I wanted to practice building a simple web page from scratch and understand how to structure HTML correctly.

## What I Learned

While making this project, I learned how to:

- Use headings and paragraphs
- Add lists for ingredients and steps
- Use image tags with `alt` text
- Keep my code clean and easy to read

## How to Open

1. Download or clone the project from GitHub.
2. Open the file called `index.html` in your browser.

Thatâ€™s it!
